Each main synced directory will have a Synch Header file that will 
list the locations of synched directory and any synched subdirectories.


synch process between two directories: dir1 and dir2
	1) check for dir1 database file : exception handling
		-is it there
		-is it corrupt
		-is there more than one
	2) check for deleted files
	3) check for new files
	4) check modification dates for all files
	
	5) do the first four steps for dir2
	
	6) delete all deleted files from both dirs if deletion is turned on
	7) copy all new files to both dirs if copy is turned on
	8) copy newly modified versions of files if update is turned on
	
	9) output log file in both locations
	
Note:
	To delete a dir, you must first delete its contents, otherwise you'll get an IOException
